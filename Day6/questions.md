# Question 21

### **Question:**

> **_A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:_**

```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```

> **_The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer._**
> **_Example:_**
> **_If the following tuples are given as input to the program:_**

```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
2
```

### Hints:

> **_In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.Here distance indicates to euclidean distance.Import math module to use sqrt function._**

# Question 22

### **Question:**

> **_Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically._**

> **_Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:_**

```
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
```

> **_Then, the output should be:_**

```
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1
```

# Question 23

### **Question:**

> **_Write a method which can calculate square value of number_**

---

### Hints:

```
Using the ** operator which can be written as n**p where means n^p
```

---

# Question 24

### **Question:**

> **_Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions._**

> **_Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()_**

> **_And add document for your own function_**

### Hints:

```
The built-in document method is __doc__
```
