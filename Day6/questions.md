# Question 21

### **Question:**

> **_A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:_**

```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```

> **_The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer._**
> **_Example:_**
> **_If the following tuples are given as input to the program:_**

```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
2
```

### Hints:

> **_In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.Here distance indicates to euclidean distance.Import math module to use sqrt function._**

# Question 22

### **Question:**

> **_Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically._**

> **_Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:_**
