# Question 36

### **Question:**

> **_Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print all values except the first 5 elements in the list._**

---

```
Hints: Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.Use [n1:n2] to slice a list
```

# Question 38

### **Question:**

> **_With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line._**

---

### Hints:

> **_Use [n1:n2] notation to get a slice from a tuple._**

---

# Question 39

### **Question:**

> **_Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)._**

---

### Hints:

> **_Use "for" to iterate the tuple. Use tuple() to generate a tuple from a list._**
