# Question 31

### **Question:**

> **_Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys._**

---

### Hints:

```
Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.
```

---

# Question 32

### **Question:**

> **_Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only._**

---

### Hints:

```
Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use keys() to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to get key/value pairs.
```

# Question 33

### **Question:**

> **_Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included)._**

---

### Hints:

```
Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.
```

# Question 34

### **Question:**

> **_Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the first 5 elements in the list._**

---

### Hints:

```
Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.Use [n1:n2] to slice a list
```
