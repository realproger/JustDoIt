# Question 7

### **Question:**

> **_Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.\***

> **_Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5_**

> **_Then, the output of the program should be:_**

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
```

### Hints:

> **_Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form._**

# Question 10

### **Question**

> **_Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically._**

> **_Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:_**

```
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
```

> **_Then, the output should be:_**

```
again and hello makes perfect practice world
```

### Hints:

> **_In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data._**

# Question 11

### **Question**

> **_Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence._**

> **_Example:_**

```
0100,0011,1010,1001
```
