# Question 1

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, 
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Hints

Consider use range(#begin, #end) method.

# Question 2

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

# Hints:

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Question 3

With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i x i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

# Hints:

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.Consider use dict()
